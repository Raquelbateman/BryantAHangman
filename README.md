 // Hangman

 // Rebuild hangman with your own style. Organize the code in a way that you hypothetically 
 would have originally set it up as. Add frequent comments explaining each portion of your code and how it relates to the architecture of the program.

* I enjoy the whimsical nature of your hangman!  It's very cute and fun to look at.  The simplicity of your html is appreciated. <br>
* I like how you've commented on nearly all of your functions and psudo code.  I can see how everything is linked up and also how they work.
